# TailCraft Base Theme

TailCraft is a clean, Tailwind CSS-based WordPress starter theme designed to provide a modern build process and an organized PHP class structure for block-based theme development. It's inspired by [TailPress](https://github.com/jeffreyvr/tailpress) and aims to offer a starting point more inline with my own site build practices.

## Features

- Tailwind CSS integration for utility-first styling
- Alpine.js for reactive components
- Modern build process for CSS and JavaScript
- Organized and fleshed-out PHP class structure
- Designed for block-based themes with ACF Pro

(Note: Additional details on features and changes from TailPress to be added.)

## Prerequisites

- PHP version 8.0 or higher
- ACF Pro for block functionality

## Installation

Please refer to the TailCraft Installer README for instructions on setting up the base theme.
